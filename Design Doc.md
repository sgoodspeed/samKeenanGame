#[Unnamed Horror Robot Game]: Design Doc

__Story__: A partially defunct cleaning robot is awakened in a haunted mansion years after it has been abandoned. The robot is made to clean up grusome messes made by the former owners of the house while fighting off the various monsters that have inhabited the house, learning the story of the house from the ghosts and slowly developing free will until it can escape.  

__Characters__: The robot, various ghosts of former aristocracy, enemies (including Goblins, Bad Ghosts, Wolfmen, Frankenstein Heads, Dire Rats, etc.) 

__Level/environment design__: The game is set in a haunted Victorian mansion that has fallen into gross disrepair.   

__Gameplay__: Gameplay consists of two main elements: Fighting and cleaning. When the player enters a room, there will be eldritch monsters to defeat before they rip the poor robot limb from limb. Once safe, the player must use problem solving to get the various messes (corpses, puddles, broken furniture, gore, etc) in the room clean before proceeding. The player will run across various electronics and other devices throughout the house that the robot is able to integrate into itself, therefore upgrading and adding new functionality to the robot.  
__Art__: We are commissioning art from Sam's sister. 

__Sound and Music__: TBD.  

__User Interface, Game Controls__: Player is controlled by the keyboard (Arrow keys for movement, space for jumping, WASD for various combat / cleaning operations.) HUD is minimal, consisting of an ammunition / cleaning supply display and possibly a health bar.
