Here we go, this is a game, we are gonna make it, woooo

OK I am just gonna write down the order of git commands here (probably these are also online?):


git add . //the dot is for everything in the folder, I guess you can also just do one part

git commit -m "this is where a comment goes"

git pus //this is the one that sends it to the site actually

git stash //hides all the changes you've made locally

git checkout ______ //designates which branch you are working on

git checkout -b _______ //creates a branch, I am pretty sure?
